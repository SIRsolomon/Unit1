# Project Unit 1

## Criterion A: Planning

### Problem Definition

#### The local advisor, the manager of a stop and clean team, has requested help with developing some software. His faithful emplyees have been struck with the strife of having to cope with inadquate software. In they passed they have used pen and paper to store their password for sensitive documents and private content but, this presents multipile limtiations such as being vulnerable to loss, destruction, theft, fire, ligtning, water, termites, a child, and most importantly rival local espionage operations. Unfortunately, a rival team has discovered their methods and began stealing their passwords in covert local espionage operations in order to gain access to their sensitive documents and private content, which included, recipies, cleaning techniques, images, more passwords, videos, text messages, reciepts, safe codes, medical documents, academic transcripts, maps, financial records, family locations, employee bathroom time records, CCTV footage.

### Proposed Solution

The proposed solution is to make a program which has a primary purpose as a front end and a secondary purpose hidden behind it in order to keep the passwords hidden and secure while the file wiht passwords will be stored separately and securely using encryption.

### Success Criteria

####
1. A basic calculator will act as the front end of the program with simple functions such as finding amount of cleaning products needed for different scenaios, for example amount of soap for plates or a load of laundry etc.
2. If the user enters the secred ("Open Sesame Please >:)"), the program will change modes and act as a password manager.
3. In password manager mode, the user should be able to perform CRUD operations (Create, Replace, Update, Delete):
   - Add password (for example, for a website).
   - Vew the stored passwords (only if they re-enter the secret code)
4. Save passwords permanantly and securely using external files and encription tools.
5. Use the terminal to interact with the user.
